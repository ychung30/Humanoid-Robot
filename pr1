 * Class: CMSC140 
 * Instructor: Abedzadeh
 * Project 1
 * Description: The Dept plans to purchase a humanoid robot. The Chairman would like you to write a program to show a greeting script the robot can use later. 
                Your first task is to use the following script to prototype the robot for presentation.
 * Due Date: 2/29/2020
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
 * I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
   I have not given my code to any student.
   Print your Name here: Yi Chung
   
 * Pseudocode or Algorithm for the program:
